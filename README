I will be trying to maintain an updated compilation of the solutions.
The solutions will be mostly be in C. Few may be in python and lisp.
The main aim is to find elegant solutions that will be be fast (< 1 sec in C and < 1 min in python). So before plagiarizing I will suggest you to have one more go at the problem.
